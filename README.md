# webcrawler
A web crawler for my IS392: Web Mining and Information Retrieval class.

This program is only compatible with Python 3.

Please grab the needed dependency before running the program by issuing: 
```
pip install lxml
```
The program will not run without it. 

There is a chance that you have multiple versions of Python on your system with Python 2 being the default. If this is the case execute the following command to run the program:
```
python3 main.py
```
